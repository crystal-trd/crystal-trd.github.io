* Hello Again (I'm back '^') + Happy pride !!! /09|06|2022/
It has been two months since i posted here, so I guess it's time to take care of this little website haha. First of all, hello!!! I hope everyone reading this is doing super fine, I myself I'm doing ok... Well apart from the fact that i lost all my account passwords after an accidental hard drive wipe, so this is why the URL has changed, and also the Discord tag.

Sinc we are in the month of June, I hope everyone is having a happy and prideful month. Everyone deserves to live & love and be loved regardless of sexuality gender of race, no religious or legal text should be able to define what you are or who you love. Don't be ashamed of being yourself and remember, you are never alone. We are in this together
* Orchid Linux /06|04|2022/
Guess who contributed to yet another Linux distro ? Its ya girl Crystal. So the distro I helped translate to English is a special one named after a lovely flower "Orchid Linux" which is a French Gentoo distro, made to be easy to install and to use [[https://github.com/wamuu-sudo/orchid][You can check it out here]]. Lovely distro, lovely people, 10/10 would recommend :3
* BIG UPDATE /03|04|2022/
Today this website
got a *B I G* upgrade in terms of style, now instead of having a static theme that never changes, this website colors change according to the colors of my setup.which are applied randomly from a number of wallpapers and extract colors from them, how awesome, right ? :D all this in pure CSS with bash magic and pywal (man I love this software)
* Kirby Return to DreamLand /02|04|2022/

* End of Exams, DWM scripts update and life updates (and more :D) /27|03|2022/
So it has been over a week since I wrote to this website that no one reads anyways. But I finally finished my examsðŸŽ‰ whouhouuuu only one year for the bacalorea exam.  I mostly did well, fucked up in maths, but hey, better than nothing :D. Also while I was not present, I took my time to revamp my dwm build (which needs a couple of pushes to my repo) and enhanced my theme picker to make it a bit nicer, with a random option and a notification  Who doesn't love some randomness in their life? As for life, well... I'm finally on a date with someone IRL, a cute guy named Luke, it means the world to me to have him with me so I wanted to share my joy with this org document. Anyways that's all, have a nice day, night or launch, see y'all
* Earthquake /19|03|2022/
As the title says, today an earthquake stroke the coast of Bejaia, named Cap Carbon, with a magnitude of 6.0. And surprisingly no bouncing quakes....weird, what is weirder is that, last year, and exactly this day (well the day before, but still) a similar.no, identical quake stroke in the Same spot with the same magnitude, only difference is that the first was at night, and today was at 11AM.
Im safe, everyone is safe and no cracks in buildings appart from the University Campus appeared.
* First impression with an android 12 rom (phone) /09|03|2022/
First of all ,sorry for being absent, life is kinda keeping me busy. ANYWAYS happy Women's Day to start with !! Sooo Android 12, after fixing my Redmi 9A, I went for the first time with a custom rom "Nusantara ROM" which uses the Android 12 version. And my first impression is: WAW. A12 is indeed a step-up from Miui Android 10. Everything goes well with eachother, a lot of privacy settings, hell i didn't even have to debloat my phone cuz it didn't have bloatware. The theming engine really reminds me of pywal on linux, but on steroides.

One small problem I had, was the fact the file manager doesn't let you choose the root of your sd card as a location for some apps, other than that, 10/10 would recommend
* I fucking hate Xiaomi and Mediatek /24|02|2022/
So yesterday, the worse thing that could happen to me, happened. While I was trying to install a custom rom on my phone (Redmi 9A) which got recommended to me by an indian guy saying "oh yeah it works on Redmi 9A" well guess what .__. It doesn't, now my phone is bootlooping, and I have 0 internet to download the ROM (4gb of size ðŸ˜­) hell ,iIdon't even know when this website will get commited, but one thing for sure: Fuck Mediatek, and fuck me for believing random indians on YouTube .__.
* Quick Patch Note /18|02|2022/
It appeared that the website fonts didn't load for people without JetBrains Mono font installed and so the website looked broken-ish ! Thank you, Marie, for letting me know <3, Now everything should be fixed...I hope, otherwise just install that font, pretty cool one I might add :D !
* HP, the keyboard, and what the fuck happened /17|02|2022/
I fucking hate this, my keyboard randomly stopped reading input from some keys, which are : aqwedcrfvtgb1345. Well guess I will have to buy a new keyboard for my HP ELITEBOOK 840 G2 (yeah pretty old laptop), it might not be that bad, since I lost the trackpoint, and it will be a great opportunity to replace it.
* Today I learned the sysrq key on my keyboard did a thing!! /16|02|2022/
I was really surprised when I found out that using *ALT+SYSRQ(the print key)+ r k*, will kill all programs EXCEPT the init on the current console.
Or *ALT+SYSRQ+r e i s u o(or b for reboot)* to shut down your pc, really cool
